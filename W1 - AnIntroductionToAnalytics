### VISUALIZING CRIME TRENDS

# Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) :  the difference between the first and third quartile values, or the height of the box
# Any point that is greater than the third quartile plus the IQR or less than the first quartile minus the IQR is considered an outlier
# For what proportion of motor vehicle thefts in 2001 was an arrest made?
sum(mvt$Year == 2001 & mvt$Arrest == "TRUE")/sum(mvt$Year == 2001)
# For what proportion of motor vehicle thefts in 2007 was an arrest made?
sum(mvt$Year == 2007 & mvt$Arrest == "TRUE")/sum(mvt$Year == 2007)
# For what proportion of motor vehicle thefts in 2012 was an arrest made?
sum(mvt$Year == 2012 & mvt$Arrest == "TRUE")/sum(mvt$Year == 2012)
