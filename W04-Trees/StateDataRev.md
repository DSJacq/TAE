#### STATE DATA REVISITED

We will be revisiting the "state" dataset from one of the optional problems in Unit 2. This dataset has, for each of the fifty U.S. states, the population, per capita income, illiteracy rate, murder rate, high school graduation rate, average number of frost days, area, latitude and longitude, division the state belongs to, region the state belongs to, and two-letter abbreviation. This dataset comes from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census.

Load the dataset into R and convert it to a data frame by running the following two commands in R:

data(state)
statedata = data.frame(state.x77)
If you can't access the state dataset in R, here is a CSV file with the same data that you can load into R using the read.csv function: statedataSimple.csv.  Be sure to call the output of the read.csv function "statedata".

After you have loaded the data into R, inspect the data set using the command: str(statedata)

This dataset has 50 observations (one for each US state) and the following 8 variables:

- Population - the population estimate of the state in 1975
- Income - per capita income in 1974
- Illiteracy - illiteracy rates in 1970, as a percent of the population
- Life.Exp - the life expectancy in years of residents of the state in 1970
- Murder - the murder and non-negligent manslaughter rate per 100,000 population in 1976 
- HS.Grad - percent of high-school graduates in 1970
- Frost - the mean number of days with minimum temperature below freezing from 1931â€“1960 in the capital or a large city of the state
- Area - the land area (in square miles) of the state
- We will try to build a model for life expectancy using regression trees, and employ cross-validation to improve our tree's performance.
